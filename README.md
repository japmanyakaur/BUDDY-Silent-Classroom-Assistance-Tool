# BUDDY-Silent-Classroom-Assistance-Tool

Not every voice is spoken. Some are tapped.

BUDDY is a low-cost assistive learning tool designed to empower non-verbal and neurodivergent children to communicate seamlessly in the classroom using simple touch gestures and real-time visual feedback. Built using the Vega Board and standard electronics, this solution won **2nd place at Vegathon 2.0**, a hardware hackathon.

## Problem Statement

Many special needs children, especially those on the autism spectrum or with speech impairments, struggle to express themselves in classroom environments. The absence of quick and silent communication tools often leads to:

- Frustration due to unmet needs  
- Missed signals by teachers  
- Decreased classroom participation and engagement

## Solution: BUDDY

BUDDY provides a silent and intuitive communication system at each child’s desk using:

- Tap-based input via touch sensor  
- Color-coded LED signals for clear visual feedback  
- A servo-powered flag that rotates to indicate task completion or participation  

This helps non-verbal children express their status in real time, while also allowing teachers to respond promptly and inclusively.

## Features

- 1 Tap → Red LED → "I need help"  
- 2 Taps → Yellow LED → "I'm confused"  
- 3 Taps → Green LED → "All good"  
- Long Press → Raises a servo-driven flag → "Task completed"

## Hardware Used

 Vega Board            
 Touch Sensor (TTP223) 
 RGB LED                
 Servo Motor (SG90)     
 Jumper Wires           
 USB Cable              
 Breadboard             
 Paper Flag       

 budget-friendly and scalable

## How It Works

1. Child taps the touch sensor  
2. System detects the tap pattern and lights up the corresponding LED  
3. A long press raises a physical flag using a servo motor  
4. Teacher sees the LED or flag and responds accordingly  
5. LED auto-resets after a few seconds
